However this is not the main focus of the project we are still mainly working on the 8 Player Build. We have download links for the recent version below and older versions if you are interested in trying it out for yourself, if you encounter any bugs or crashes we would appreciate it if you could send me an email with the error code.

Another thing that i want to add is having a video player in the matchroom page of the game where people can watch the game on the website instead of having to download the demo. But the demo download will always be available for those who are comfortable using the Dedcon client."
