                <p>Welcome to the Official Website for DEFCON Expanded, the 8-16 player mod for DEFCON. The mod is months in the making and 
                wouldn't have been possible without some talented people who are passionate about the game. The mod is still in its infancy 
                and we suggest you email me or contact one of us on Discord if any bugs or issues arise.</p>
                <p>The website is also currently still in development, so dont be concerned if you see any issues or broken elements. I am currently making live changes
                   so things might change quickly from one day to another, i hope everyone understands <i class="fas fa-smile"></i></p>

                <h3>Bomber Launch (Empty)</h3>
                <p>The new empty bomber launch mode allows you to launch a bomber without arming a nuke, allowing you to use the bomber to pick up a warhead at the base of your choosing. This provides more strategic flexibility in managing your nuclear arsenal.</p>
                <h3>Color Picker</h3>
                <p>On opening the Alliance toolbar tab, you will see a new window that lists all of the team colors. You can now choose your team color, adding a new level of customization to your gameplay experience.</p>

                <h3>16 Available Team Colors!</h3>
                <p>We've expanded the color palette from the original 6 colors to 16, giving players more options to distinguish their teams. The new colors include Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Cyan, Pink, Black, Orange, Olive, Scarlet, Indigo, Gold, Dark Teal, Purple, White, and Brown.</p>
                <h3>Unit Outlines</h3>
                <p>To improve visibility, especially for darker colors and units over the ocean, we've added a thin white highlight around every unit.</p>

            <h3>Dev Blog by FasterThanRaito</h3>
            <p class="pabout">After a long wait the 16 Player build is now ready for everyone to play and test! dont be hesitant to send in any bugs or issues that you find
                              in the build as its just been released. If you want to know more about the 16 Player build in detail FasterThanRaito has made a dev blog
                              which you can find here</p>
            <p class="pabout">The original DEFCON was split into 6 continent-like territories. With DEFCON Expanded, we are able to introduce more players and thus 
                               the need to divide the world into more parts. 8 Players attempt to keep as true to the vanilla experience as possible, but with 16 player it is simply 
                               not possible to adhere to purely geographic boundaries any more.</p>
                                
            <p class="pabout">So, we have decided to divide the world along not just geographic lines but also regional cultural ones to make sensible factions which could plausibly present a 
                               united front while being balanced in territorial size relative to each other. Another factor is the number of cities in each territory. 
                               In default mode, each territory should have a minimum of 25 cities, but some parts of the world are so sparsely populated that no amount of pure territorial 
                               coverage would give them the required city count.</p>
            <p class="pabout">Starting with the Americas, North America has been split between the USA and Canada.
                               Canada has a lot of empty space and no cities, so I decided to combine it with parts of Europe, that will be touched on later.
                               South America is split between Hispanic Latin America and Brazil, with Hispanic America again split into a cleaner north and south.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">In Europe, to Canada goes the British Isles, but due to lack of cities, I also added Scandinavia.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">Europe has been much reduced in size, but is still comparable to the other factions.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">Since I don't believe in splitting apart individual countries, Russia remains intact as its own faction.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">Africa is split into three parts - West/Central, South/East, and North. The division between central and south follows the borders of Congo, 
                               while the division between north and center follows the borders of the Afro-Asiatic countries (so technically not Arabic but the larger family 
                               that Arabic is a part of, which includes Ethiopia).</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">Asia is split between China, India, and the islands.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">In between Eurasia is the Middle East which is the collection of non-Arabic, non-Indic countries between Europe, Russia, and China. 
                               Thankfully it happens to be roughly analogous to other factions in size.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">And Finally we have Australia and Antarctica to round out the extreme edge of the planet's territory. Some of Antarctica is part of 
                               Australia in order to give Australia the appropriate number of cities, though this does mean Antarctic territory is left over as the last 
                               territory with significantly fewer cities than 25, unless we add more city data later.</p>
                
            <p class="pabout">Note that in order to have any population at all in those southernmost cities, we used data on penguin colonies rather than human settlements. 
                               It seems this game takes place in an alternate universe where sentient Penguins have armed themselves with nuclear weapons.</p>
